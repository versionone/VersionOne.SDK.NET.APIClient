# VersionOne .NET SDK
Copyright (c) 2008-2015 [VersionOne](http://versionone.com/).
All rights reserved.

The VersionOne .NET SDK is a free and open-source library that accelerates software development of applications that integrate with VersionOne. The SDK serves as a wrapper to the VersionOne REST API, eliminating the need to code the infrastructure necessary for direct handling of HTTP requests and responses.

The .NET SDK is open source and is licensed under a modified BSD license, which reflects our intent that software built with a dependency on the SDK can be for commercial and/or open source products.

## System Requirements

* .NET Framework 4.5.1

## Supported IDEs for Development

* Visual Studio 2013

## Adding the .NET SDK to your Project

Use the [NuGet](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/overview) package manager from Visual Studio or nuget.exe. Search for `VersionOne.SDK.NET.APIClient` to find the precompiled package.  

Alternatively, the compiled version of the .NET SDK is available as a downloadable ZIP file from the [VersionOne Application Catalog](http://appcatalog.versionone.com/VersionOne.SDK.NET.APIClient). When you extract the ZIP file, you will find a file named VersionOne.SDK.APIClient-XXX.dll that you can reference in your .NET project.

## Vewing the Documentation
Conceptual documentation with code samples for the .NET SDK is available in the [VersionOne Developer Library](https://community.versionone.com/Developers/Developer-Library/Documentation/.NET_SDK).
