# VersionOne SDK.NET #
Copyright (c) 2008-2012 VersionOne, Inc.
All rights reserved.

For developers who have an itch that VersionOne doesn't scratch, the 
VersionOne SDK.NET is a free, community-driven, open-source toolkit 
written in C# that accelerates software development of tools that 
tailor VersionOne to better fit with new practices and other tools. 
Unlike direct use of the REST API, the VersionOne SDK.NET provides a 
framework for application development on the .NET stack and tools to 
make development of those applications fast and easy. The framework 
and tools are driven from experience developing code to solve real 
problems.

This product includes software developed at VersionOne 
(http://versionone.com/). This product is open source and is licensed 
under a modified BSD license, which reflects our intent that software 
built with a dependency on the  VersionOne SDK.NET can be commercial or 
open source, as the authors see fit.
